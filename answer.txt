Answer of stage 6:
1. git merge conflicts, find the conflicting file according to the prompt, and resolve the conflict
If the file conflicts, there will be a similar mark

2. After modification, execute git add to conflict file name

3. Go to the operation interface similar to vim and delete the conflict-related lines

4. Push directly, because the merge operation has just been performed

OR

The Recursive strategy:

The Recursive strategy is the default strategy adopted by Git when merging two branches. 
It only applies to merging between two branches. 
Therefore, for the merging of more than two branches, 
it is necessary to repeatedly merge in pairs to finally complete the merging of all branches (this is also the origin of the name Recursive). 
In essence, Recursive is a kind of Three-Way Merge. 
Its characteristic is that if Git finds more than one common ancestor that meets the conditions on the two branches participating i
n the merge when looking for a common ancestor, 
it will merge the common ancestor first and create a temporary snapshot. 
Then, use the temporarily generated "virtual ancestor" as the basis for merging, and then merge the branches.
